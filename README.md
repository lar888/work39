# 🐦 React Post Card App

This is a simple React application demonstrating the use of a **stateful** and a **stateless** component:

- `StatefulComponent`: A card that displays a post and toggles the full description using React's `useState`.
- `StatelessComponent`: A quote banner that receives its data through props.
